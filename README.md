# Federated-Self-Sovereignity

Before cloning and test this repo please install the [pre-requisites](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-prereqs.html) and Hyperledger Composer [development environment](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/development-tools.html) .

The environment can be set up very easily using `Thesis.sh` with the options  `[-h] [-u version] [-d]`  where:
```
-h show help text
-u launch network
-d purge network"
```
Note that the version should be the same defined in `package.json`.

The network can be quickly populated through the rest server (`composer-rest-server`) and executing `genesis.sh`.
